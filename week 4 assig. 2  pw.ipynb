    "Ans: Abstraction allows programmers to create a simplified model of an object, focusing only on the relevant information and actions needed to interact with it. It provides a level of abstraction that enables the user to work with objects at a higher level, without needing to understand the internal implementation details.\n"

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Data abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) can be achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstraction allows the representation of complex real-world entities as simplified models within the software system, focusing only on the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",

    "Declare Abstract Methods: Abstract methods are methods that are declared in the abstract base class but do not have an implementation. They serve as a contract or template for methods that subclasses must implement. Abstract methods are defined using the `abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module.\n",

Abstract methods are declared in the abstract class but left undefined, and their implementation is expected to be provided by the concrete subclasses.\n",
